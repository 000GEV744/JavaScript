<!-- Note=> document object model: each of the tags like html,head, title..ect
are refered as objects in the Document object Model and html comprises of heirarchy 
; so the term model comes.
so javascript requires the DOM with which 
it can manipute the attributes of the objects present in the 
html page using DOM -->

<!-- DOM stands for Document Object Model -->
    <head>
        <title>
            Web Page
        </title>
<!-- there are two different ways by which 
we can include in your html
i.e either by using <script> tag  or we can 
have a separate javascript file with extension of .js and
can include that file using the same <script> tag-->

        <script src="htmlDoc.js" type="text/javascript">
        //    document.write("Hello world"); 
        //    //document is basically the object that represents the entire document and we can also write the html tag inside the write() fuction
        //    document.write("<h2>Hi, this is anuj</h2>")
        </script>
    <!-- we can include the <script> tag anywhere inside the page i.e can be include inside the body, outside the body.     -->
