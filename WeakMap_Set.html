      /* WEAKMAP :: the first diff between map and WeakMap is the keys in weakMap must be Objects, not primitive types 
        Compare it with the regular Map example above.      
        Now if john only exists as the key of WeakMap – it will be automatically deleted from the map (and memory).
        the main area of application of weakmap is and additional data storage.
        
        Weakmap deos not support iteration and methods keys(), values(), entries()
        WeakMap has only the following methods ::
        weakMap.get(key), weakMap.set(key, value), weakMap.delete(key),weakMap.has(key)

        USE CASES no.1::
        If we’re working with an object that “belongs” to another code, maybe even a third-party library,
        and would like to store some data associated with it,
        that should only exist while the object is alive – then WeakMap is exactly what’s needed.*/
