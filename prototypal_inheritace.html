      /*protoypal inheritance is a language feature that helps in that.
      In JavaScript, objects have a special hidden property [[Prototype]] (as named in the specification),
      that is either null or references another object. That object is called “a prototype”:
      The property [[Prototype]] is internal and hidden, but there are many ways to set it.
      One of them is to use __proto__, like this  :: */

      there are two limitations :
      1. the references cant go in circles, javascript will throw an error if we try to assign __proto__ in a circle.
      2. the value of __proto__ can be either an object or null. other types are ignored.

      important note::
      No matter where the method is found: in an object or its prototype.
      In a method call, this is always the object before the dot.
