    In web-development we meet binary data mostly while dealing with files (create, upload, download).
     Another typical use case is image processing.
    there is a bit confusion, because there are many classes. to name a few :
     => ArrayBuffer, Uint8Array, DataView, Blob, File, etc.

      /*
      Let’s eliminate a possible source of confusion. ArrayBuffer has nothing in common with Array:
        It has a fixed length, we can’t increase or decrease it.
        It takes exactly that much space in the memory.
        To access individual bytes, another “view” object is needed, not buffer[index].
